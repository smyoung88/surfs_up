## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to analyze temperature trends to assist an entrepreneur with their decision making process on whether or not to open up a surf and icecream shop in Oahu. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu are being analyzed in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results 
The temperature analysis data is shown below:

<b> Three key differences in weather between June and December are:</b><br/>
1. There are 183 more temperature samples in June than in December.
2. The weather gets 8 degrees cooler in the winter than in the summer.
3. All other statistics are within 4 degrees of each other.

## Summary
Oahu, HI is a city where the weather ranges anywhere from 56 degrees to 85 degrees. This is a place where the swells are tall and the weather would always be favorable for a savory ice cream cone. A few different queries that could be ran to solidify this analysis would be to:
1. Query the count of data points per month to make sure roughtly the same amount of data points are in each month's sample so the overall statistics are not biased more towards one part of the year over the other.
2. Bring in data where you could query all aspects of the weather, not just the temperature. Ideally, when opening a surf and ice cream shop, you would want it to be sunny and 75, not rainy. Even on the nicest of temperature days, I would bet business for both surfing and ice cream sales would decrease during rainy days. A query of this data followed by a visualization showing those relationships would be useful when analyzing weather between June and December in Oahu.
